Stylesheet: IE Stylesheet

So instead of using the respond.js file to add media query support
to IE, we're going to use LESS to create an easily readable css file.
Here, we import all the styles the standard stylesheet gets, only
without the media queries. No need to worry about editing anything!

******************************************************************/

/*
Base.css contains the main mobile styles and is called in the 
header. This way mobile devices get ONLY the styles that apply
to them. No muss, no fuss.

normalize.css and the mixins are also called within that base file 

let's now call the FUNCTIONS for these different stylesets. This
doesn't load the CSS, the CSS is loaded directly below.
*/

@import "600up";
@import "960up";
/* 
you can call the larger styles if you want, but there's really no need 
*/

/*
Now we call the functions that contain all the CSS. This means
you don't have to maintain an IE stylesheet AND a standard 
responsive stylesheet.
*/

.600up();
.960up();

ADDITIONAL IE FIXES
These fixes are now ONLY seen by IE, so you don't have to worry
about using prefixes, although it's best practice. For more info

/*
For example, you can use something like:

.no-textshadow .class { ... }

You can also target specific versions by using something like:

.ie7 .class { ... }
